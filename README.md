# Traffic-Signs-Classification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train a model that classifies German traffic signs. The model is trained on over 35,000 images spanning 43 different classes from the GTSRB dataset. Once trained, the model is integrated with OpenCV to perform real-time traffic sign detection using a webcam.
