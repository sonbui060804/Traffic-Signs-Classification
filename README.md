ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Classification with CNN and Real-Time Detection using OpenCV
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train a model that classifies German traffic signs. The model is trained on over 35,000 images spanning 43 different classes from the GTSRB dataset. Once trained, the model is integrated with OpenCV to perform real-time traffic sign detection using a webcam.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
TensorFlow & Keras â€“ For building and training the CNN model

OpenCV â€“ For capturing and processing real-time video from a webcam

Python â€“ Main programming language

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
Trains a deep learning model to classify 43 types of traffic signs

Real-time sign detection and classification using a simple webcam

Easy-to-adapt framework for your own datasets

Includes performance insights: training time and per-class image requirements

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Name: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)

Total Images: Over 35,000

Number of Classes: 43 traffic sign categories

ðŸ•’ Additional Info
Training time depends on hardware; typically ranges from several minutes to a few hours

For good accuracy, each class should have at least a few hundred images
